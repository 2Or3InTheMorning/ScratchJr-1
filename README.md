# ScratchJr

All ScratchJr projects are located in ./Projects path, where each .sjr file is a single ScratchJr project.

1) If you download a ScratchJr project from your tablet (Android or iOS), then you only have to select to open this file with the ScratchJr application.

2) If you download a Scratch project on your desktop (any Operating System), then first you have to send this file to your tablet (i.e. with an email or save it in a common/ cloud storage) and apply the instruction given on the previous paragraph.

Enjoy!
